<h1>History</h1>
<h3>The Gorkha War</h3>
The Gurkha War also known as Anglo Nepal War broke out in 1814 and ended 1816, due to a disagreement. The ruthless British declared war at the end of 1813. The gruesome war took place in Nepal. It was a war between the Kingdom of Nepal now called the Federal Democratic Republic Nepal, against British East Company. Fortunately for The British East Company, they had twenty-two thousand men as well as guns. However,The Kingdom of Nepal had less than twelve thousand men and not as many resources. The British had more cannons and guns, also a difference of six-thousand men. Lots of cannonballs were fired by the British. Consequently for the Nepalese , because of all of the cannons, guns and men the British had, lots of the Nepalese army had been either injured or killed. As a result, the British won this horrific war and the war was over.
