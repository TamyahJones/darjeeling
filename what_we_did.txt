* I planned the design
    - map of india
    - title "Darjeeling - Land of Thunderbolt" (with image of thundebolt?)
    - scrolling does not move map
* I created the web site (a text file called darjeeling.html).  
Inside this file are instructions for how to make the website.  
The web brower on the computer uses these instructions to make the page.

Contained in the web page are
  - a background image (this I created in Inkscape and saved as a bitmap)
